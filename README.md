# Suicide Cases in India (2001-2012) - Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing suicide cases in India from 2001 to 2012. The analysis is performed using various visualizations and statistical techniques to uncover trends, causes, and demographic factors that influenced suicide rates during this period.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Provide insights into the various causes of suicide (such as family issues, marriage-related problems, illnesses, and more).
- Analyze suicide rates by demographic factors like gender, age, and state.
- Visualize the trends in suicide rates over the years.
- Examine the impact of different causes of suicides, including failures in examination, illegitimate pregnancies, and love affairs.

### Key Objectives:
- Understand how suicide rates differ by gender (male vs female).
- Analyze suicide causes like family issues, illness, marriage problems, and more.
- Evaluate suicide rates by states and union territories.
- Calculate suicide rates per 100,000 people based on population estimates.
- Visualize and present key findings using graphs and charts.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Government of India, with data on suicide cases from 2001 to 2012 across various states and union territories. The dataset contains information on the following:
- Yearly suicide cases
- Causes of suicide
- Gender and age of individuals
- State and union territories
- Demographic breakdown of suicide cases

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleaned and formatted the data for analysis, filling in missing values and normalizing the data.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed suicide cases by gender, state, and cause of death.
- **Statistical Measures**: Calculated mean, variance, and standard deviation of suicide rates across states and years.
- **Suicide Rate Calculation**: Added a calculated column for Suicide Rate per 100,000 people.
  
### Visualizations:
- **Suicide trends over the years** (line plots)
- **Suicide rates by gender** (bar charts)
- **Suicide rates by state** (choropleth maps)
- **Causes of suicides** visualized by various categories

## Visualizations

The project contains multiple visualizations that help understand the data more effectively:

- **Line Plot** showing the trend of suicides over the years.
- **Bar Chart** depicting suicide rates by gender (Male/Female).
- **Heatmap** showing the distribution of suicide cases across states.
- **Pie Charts** illustrating the percentage distribution of suicide causes.

### Examples:
- **Figure: Suicide Trend by Year (2001â€“2012)**
- **Figure: Suicide Rate by Gender (Male vs Female)**

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical measures were computed to understand the variability and spread of suicide cases:

- **Mean**: The average number of suicides per state/year.
- **Standard Deviation**: The spread of suicides across different states.
- **Variance**: How widely the suicide rates vary across different states.
